*DESCRIPTION*:

A pipelined processor is a type of CPU architecture that improves instruction throughput by dividing instruction execution into multiple stages, allowing multiple instructions to be in progress simultaneously. In this project, a 4-stage pipelined processor was designed using Verilog HDL, supporting three basic instructions: ADD, SUB, and LOAD. The four stages implemented are Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), and Write Back (WB). The goal of the project was to understand pipeline architecture, instruction flow, hardware design using Verilog, and simulation using Vivado.

Working Principle of the 4-Stage Pipeline

Instruction Fetch (IF):
In this stage, the program counter (PC) is used to fetch the instruction from instruction memory. After fetching, PC increments to point to the next instruction.
Instruction Decode (ID):
The instruction is decoded into opcode, source registers, destination register, and immediate fields. In this stage, the register file is read, and operand values are sent to the next stage.
Execute (EX):
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs ADD or SUB operations. For LOAD instructions, this stage computes the memory address by adding a base register value and an offset.
Write Back (WB):
The final result generated by the EX stage is written back into the destination register.
Pipeline registers (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/WB) are used between stages to store intermediate results. This ensures proper timing and isolates concurrent instructions.

Simulation and Results

The processor was tested using a short program that performs a sequence of ADD, SUB, and LOAD operations. A Verilog testbench was created to apply the clock, reset, and monitor all internal pipeline registers. The simulation waveform clearly shows all four stages active at the same time with different instructions.

For example:
In Cycle 1, instruction 1 is in IF.
In Cycle 2, instruction 1 moves to ID, while instruction 2 enters IF.
In Cycle 3, instruction 1 is in EX, instruction 2 in ID, and instruction 3 in IF.
This overlap demonstrates correct pipeline behavior. The simulation results confirm that the processor executes instructions correctly and achieves improved throughput compared to non-pipelined designs.

Tools Used (Vivado)

The project was implemented and simulated using Xilinx Vivado, a widely used FPGA development tool. Vivado was chosen because it supports:
Verilog design entry
HDL synthesis and elaboration
Advanced waveform simulation
Register and memory visualization
FPGA implementation and timing analysis
Vivado’s simulation environment allows viewing pipeline stages, internal registers, and instruction flow clearly. The tool also supports resource estimation and performance evaluation.

Performance Analysis

The designed pipelined processor improves overall instruction throughput because multiple instructions overlap in execution. Once the pipeline is filled, the processor completes one instruction per clock cycle. The latency of a single instruction remains four cycles, but throughput increases significantly.
The design uses minimal hardware: a register file, ALU, pipeline registers, and instruction memory. Power consumption is low due to simple combinational and sequential blocks. The architecture scales well, meaning new instructions, hazard units, and forwarding mechanisms can be added easily.
